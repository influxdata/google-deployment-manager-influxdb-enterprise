### Welcome to the InfluxDB Enterprise configuration file.

# The values in this file override the default values used by the system if
# a config option is not specified.  The commented out lines are the configuration
# field and the default value used.  Uncommenting a line and changing the value
# will change the value used at runtime when the process is restarted.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB Enterprise will report usage data to usage.influxdata.com
# The data includes a random ID, os, arch, version, the number of series and other
# usage data. No data from user databases is ever transmitted.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
